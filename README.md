This is a repository for all my projects with data science focus like machine learning and web scraping.

In project 1, I perfom a web scraping and plot the number of newcomers in online vs face-to-face classes in Brazil, 2020.

In project 4, I create a mmodel predictor for clients for travel insurance purchases, and display factors that affect the purchase of it.
